        <h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">Hello, my name is Kusal. <span class="sentence">I love to play soccer and I'm from Nepal.</span> 
            I enjoy spending my weekends on the field with my friends, competing in local matches.</p>
    
            <p>I have a wonderful family, and we often spend weekends together. 
            My parents have always encouraged me to pursue my dreams, and their support means everything to me. 
            <span class="sentence">One of my favorite childhood memories is learning to ride a bicycle with my dad.</span></p>
    
            <p>When I am not working or studying, I enjoy playing video games. 
            Gaming allows me to unwind and stay connected with friends. 
            <span class="sentence">I am also a fan of science fiction movies as well as horror movies and books.</span></p>
    
            <p>Currently, I am working on improving my web development skills. 
            Learning HTML and CSS has been both challenging and rewarding. 
            <span class="sentence">I look forward to creating more complex web pages in the future.</span></p>
